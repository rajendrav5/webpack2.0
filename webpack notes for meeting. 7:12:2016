https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples/multiple-commons-chunks

questions :
1. are we going with multiple repos for each page ?
yes, because there is a lot of scope for flash pages, offer pages, and others . And each owner will take care of his repo and bundling.


1. separate npm module for global css (normalise, colors, fonts, etc...) and consume for bundling in webpack -- not every repo will start with common components
    Bootstrapping thus made easy with npm module.

bundle for higher order components like route, vendor.
webpack bundle for shared components



Done so far:
1. Exploring to webpack 2.0
2. Implementing Tree shaking
3. Minification and de-duplication
4. Integration of postcss with webpack2.0.
5. Implemented seamless Hot module replacement.
6. Separate webpacks for dev,qa, prod.
7. Generating app.js














long run :
webpack to declare multiple vendor list for multiple set of pages .
webpack to bundle tablet / mobile css
webpack to bundle android / window / iOS css
route wise bundling
