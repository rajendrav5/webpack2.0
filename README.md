![Webpack 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajendrav5/webpack2.0/master/webpack2.0.png)

This app setup allows to generate different chunks for commons bundle, page level bundle, library bundle, separate bundle for css and optimizes the bundle with tree-shaking, minification and other optimisations.

### Usage

```
npm start ENV=DEV / npm start for dev bundle (comes with elaborate source map and other dev level artifacts to enable debugging)
npm start ENV=PROD for production bundle
```

Then open `http://localhost:6556` on your browser.
